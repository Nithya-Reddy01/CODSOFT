## SMS Spam Detection
During my internship at Codsoft, I undertook a project to develop an AI model capable of accurately classifying SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Employing the SMS Spam Collection Dataset from Kaggle, the model leveraged the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique for feature extraction. To classify the messages, I experimented with various algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

To ensure optimal model performance, the dataset underwent rigorous preprocessing, including converting labels to binary values and splitting the data into training and testing sets. The models were trained and evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, ROC and Precision-Recall curves were plotted to provide a visual representation of model performance. This project significantly enhanced my proficiency in machine learning and data science, equipping me with the skills necessary to tackle future challenges in this field.

## Credit Card Fraud Detection
Another project I undertook during my internship focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. Utilizing the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle, I explored Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests as potential classifiers. The project involved essential data preprocessing steps, addressing class imbalance, and evaluating model performance using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

Among the models tested, the Random Forest algorithm exhibited superior performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of ensemble methods in fraud detection. This project provided valuable insights into the application of machine learning in real-world scenarios, particularly in safeguarding financial transactions.

## Customer Churn Prediction
In addition to the aforementioned projects, I also undertook a customer churn prediction project as part of a solo remote internship with Codsoft. The objective of this project was to predict which customers were likely to discontinue their services. The dataset used, "Churn_Modelling.csv," contained various customer attributes.

The project involved a comprehensive data analysis process, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. To gain deeper insights into the data and model performance, I employed visualizations such as confusion matrices, feature importance plots, and correlation heatmaps. This project further solidified my skills in data science and machine learning, providing a solid foundation for future endeavors.
